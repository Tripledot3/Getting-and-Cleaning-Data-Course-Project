# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
'CodeBook.md' = describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

'tidydata' = the dataset that is a result of the steps in the run.analysis.R file

'run.analysis.R' = This is a step by step file that goes over the following steps:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
